```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


## Getting Started
- create a list of R packages required

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
packages <- c('sf', 'tidyverse', 'tmap')
for (p in packages) {
  if (!require(p, character.only = T)) {
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
